OPENING SEQUENCE: A FAIRYTALE BOOK
Voiceover: Shrek
Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) (Page is ripped out.)
CUT TO: OUTDOOR TOILET.

Montage of various Shrek activities. In a nearby town, the villagers get together to go after the ogre..
CUT TO: NIGHT. THE SWAMP.
Ites night time, the men from town have lit torches and are running into the swamp. They arrive at Shrekes home.
MAN 1
Think it's in there?
MAN 2
All right. Let's get it!
MAN 1
Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?
MAN 3
Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread. Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.
SHREK
Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.
MEN
No!
SHREK
They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!
Actually, it's quite good on toast.
MAN 1
Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (He waves the torch at Shrek.)
(Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch.)
MAN 1
Right!
(The men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly, the men roar loudly back. His long and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the men are in the dark.)
SHREK
(Whispers to Man 1.) This is the part where you run away.
(The men scramble to run away. He laughs.) And stay out!
(He looks down and picks up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and throws the paper over his shoulder.)
CUT TO: DAYTIME. THE FOREST.
There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures to him. There are cages all around. We see Peter Pan, Tinkerbell, the seven dwarves, Gipetto and Pinocchio, and the three little pigs.
GUARD
All right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
HEAD GUARD
